General Idea: Elections and politics hold significant importance as they greatly impact people's lives. However, individuals are often preoccupied with their own daily affairs, leaving little time to browse numerous websites, conduct thorough research, and make well-informed decisions regarding their votes. While there exist various websites offering polling, forecasts, and election results, there is a noticeable lack of platforms that provide comprehensive coverage of candidates, their positions, and relevant news pertaining to specific races. My website aims to address this gap by offering election data that appeals to nerds like myself, while also prioritizing accessibility for regular individuals. It will provide a convenient and efficient means for people to swiftly access information on candidates' positions, voting history, and other relevant details related to the races they will be voting in, enabling them to make informed decisions on Election Day.
